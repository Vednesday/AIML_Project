# AIML_Project
This project implements a Flappy bird game with integrated Neural Network Architecture capabilities. The AI opponent learns and improves its gameplay over time through NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)  algorithms by playing against itself. After the learning phase, it will utilizes its learned strategies.
